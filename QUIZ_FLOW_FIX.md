# Quiz Flow Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Question Counter Going to 6/5
**Problem:** After answering the 5th question, signaling "Next" would try to go to question 6/5.

**Solution:** Added validation in gesture handler to prevent advancing beyond the last question:
```typescript
// Only allow next if not on the last question OR if an answer is selected on last question
if (currentQuestionIndex < questions.length - 1 || 
    (currentQuestionIndex === questions.length - 1 && selectedOption !== null)) {
  handleNext();
}
```

### 2. ‚ùå Manual Next Required on Last Question
**Problem:** User had to manually signal "Next" after answering the 5th question.

**Solution:** Auto-advance to level complete screen after answering the last question:
```typescript
// If this is the last question and user just answered it, auto-advance after a short delay
if (currentQuestionIndex === questions.length - 1) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    handleNext();
  }, 1500); // 1.5 second delay to show the selection
}
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Celebration Only After Passing (Already Working)
**Confirmed:** Confetti celebration only triggers when:
- User reaches 'final-results' screen (after completing all 3 levels)
- User's overall percentage >= 70% (PASSING_SCORE)

No celebration occurs after completing Easy or Medium levels - only after passing the entire quiz!

## Key Changes

### 1. Gesture Handler Update
**File:** `src/pages/Index.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
} else if (gestureLower === "next") {
  handleNext(); // ‚ùå Could go beyond last question
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
} else if (gestureLower === "next") {
  // Only allow next if not on the last question OR if an answer is selected on last question
  if (currentQuestionIndex < questions.length - 1 || 
      (currentQuestionIndex === questions.length - 1 && selectedOption !== null)) {
    handleNext();
  }
}
```

### 2. Auto-Advance on Last Question
**File:** `src/pages/Index.tsx`

**Added to `handleOptionSelect`:**
```typescript
// If this is the last question and user just answered it, auto-advance after a short delay
if (currentQuestionIndex === questions.length - 1) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    handleNext();
  }, 1500); // 1.5 second delay to show the selection
}
```

- Prevents jarring immediate transition
- Allows toast notification to be visible

### Gesture Validation
- Checks if on last question
- Ensures answer is selected before allowing advance
- Prevents going beyond question array bounds

### Celebration Logic
- Only triggers on `gameState === 'final-results'`
- Only if `percentage >= PASSING_SCORE` (70%)
- Uses confetti library for visual effect
- 3 second duration with continuous animation
